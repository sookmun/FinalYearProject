 LESH (Local Energy based Shape Histogram) feature Extraction
 
 usage: [lesh]=calc_LESH(im)

Input: 
im = Image or Local patch

output: 
 Shape_vect= LESH feature vector (128 dimentional for 16 partitions and 512 dimentional for 64 partitions of the 
             image/patch. (see FeatureParam.m)
 
 

Works on image or patch of any size (preferably square). 

Recomended partition size `w' is 8 (512-dim vector) for an image of size greater than 64x64. In patches of size 32x32, partition size should be changed to 4 (to yield a 128 dim vector) 

NOTE; There are a number of parametes to adjust for different applications.
file FeatureParam.m may be modified to change e.g. the number of scale and orientation of GABOR filter. partion size may be changed to yield a longer vector or vice versa, more coarse partions or more fine partions may affect the discrimination quality of feature vector. 
Recomended settings are 8x8(64) partition size(512-dimenstional vector) and 5 scales and 8 orientations for GABOR filter bank.

Please Note: This updated version does not include the Gaussian weighing as describe in the paper, with the current optimzation, we have found it works better for general shape descriptions.
